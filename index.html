<b>Our Project</b>
<br>
<p>Ocean Ninja is based off of the game Fruit Ninja, but instead of cutting fruit you will be collecting garbage with your mouse or finger by sliding it on the screen. While collecting garbage you need to avoid swiping up a fish as it will give you a strike, three strikes and youâ€™re out. Do your best to avoid fishes and collect the most garbage!
</p>
<br><br>
<b>Our Inspiration</b>
<br>
<p>The challenge that Ocean Ninja addresses is the pollution of our oceans and it affecting the ecosystem. It is our responsibility to clean up the ocean so marine animals have a safe environment and will not go extinct. Humans have been damaging many underwater ecosystems with garbage from land that has been thrown down there. If nothing is done about this many marine animals will go extinct and future generations will never be able to see them.
</p>

<b>Our Design Process</b>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>We came up with this idea by wanting to make a more arcade type game and thought of stuff we played in our childhood</li>
  <li>Our thoughts evolved into making a game that has the garbage and fishes floating around</li>
  <li>Our project will use swiping to collect the fish like in the original game but with different things to collect and avoid</li>
</ol><br>
